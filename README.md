401 JS --  Lab 03 file system
===

## Description

Created assets and individual directories. Currently having issues with the test file. Was able to properly read-files.js and index.js working properly in the command line. Read-files runs asyncronous code to pull each individual text document in the appropriate order. fs.readfiles runs through each respective item in the array. Index.js uses argv to check whether there are the appropriate number of items populating the assets folder being pushed into the array.
